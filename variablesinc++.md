A variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program.

1.The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution.
2.A variable is only a name given to a memory location, all the operations done on the variable effects that memory    location.
3.In C++, all the variables must be declared before use.

Now let us understand the concept of variable with the example of a bucket. See bucket is a object that stores water or any kind of liquid substance so here bucket is acting as a variable which stores liquid type of data, and the value of variable bucket will be equal to the volume of liquid stored in it.Now suppose a bucket is storing liquid of volume 32 units, then it will be declared as----     liquid bucket=32; ---------- here liquid represents datatype, bucket is the variable, and 32 is the value.No No, don't panic liquid in not an actual datatype in any of the languages, it is here just as an example.
Now let us see the declaration of  a variable of integer datatype.(int datatype is used to store integer values upto 4 bytes or upto 2 bytes in some compilers, well thats the topic for another article) the declaration is as follows--
                                                              int a=20;
here a is the variable of integer type which stores value 20.
Now, think, if we want to store liquid which is greater than the capacity of previous bucket taken, then we would be requiring another bucket of bigger size ,similarly, to store integer values greater than 4 bytes i.e. greater than size of int, we use another datatype which long (size 8 bytes).

I hope that this article would have helped you in strenthening your concept of variables.
Thank you.
